[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](https://chriskhanhtran.github.io/posts/vn-food-classifier/)

I built a Computer Vision application to recognize popular Vietnamese dishes and display their information and stories. To build the application, I crawled 6,000 images using the Bing Image Search API and trained a ResNet-50 model. The model achieved 94% accuracy over 11 classes.

### CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

This is my complete implementation of assignments and projects in [***CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition***](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) by Stanford (Spring, 2019). NumPy implementations of forward and backward pass of each layer in a convolutional neural network have given me a deep understanding of how state-of-the-art Computer Vision architectures work under the hood. In addition, I explored the inner beauty of Deep Learning by implementing Style Transfer, Deep Dream, Texture Systhesis in PyTorch and generating new images with GANs.

### Social Media Analytics for Airline Industry: Fine-tuning BERT for Sentiment Analysis

[![Run in Google Colab](https://img.shields.io/badge/Colab-Run_in_Google_Colab-blue?logo=Google&logoColor=FDBA18)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1f32gj5IYIyFipoINiC8P3DvKat-WWLUK)

The release of Google's BERT is described as the beginning of a new era in NLP. In this notebook I'll use the HuggingFace's transformers library to fine-tune pretrained BERT model for a classification task. Then I will compare BERT's performance with a baseline model, in which I use a TF-IDF vectorizer and a Naive Bayes classifier. The transformers library helps us quickly and efficiently fine-tune the state-of-the-art BERT model and yield an accuracy rate 10% higher than the baseline model.

### Detect Food Trends from Facebook Posts: Co-occurence Matrix, Lift and PPMI

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](https://chriskhanhtran.github.io/minimal-portfolio/projects/detect-food-trends-facebook.html)
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/facebook-detect-food-trends)

First I build co-occurence matrices of ingredients from Facebook posts from 2011 to 2015. Then, to identify interesting and rare ingredient combinations that occur more than by chance, I calculate Lift and PPMI metrics. Lastly, I plot time-series data of identified trends to validate my findings. Interesting food trends have emerged from this analysis.

### Detect Spam Messages: TF-IDF and Naive Bayes Classifier

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](https://chriskhanhtran.github.io/minimal-portfolio/projects/detect-spam-nlp.html)
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/detect-spam-messages-nlp/blob/master/detect-spam-nlp.ipynb)

In order to predict whether a message is spam, first I vectorized text messages into a format that machine learning algorithms can understand using Bag-of-Word and TF-IDF. Then I trained a machine learning model to learn to discriminate between normal and spam messages. Finally, with the trained model, I classified unlabel messages into normal or spam.

After my team preprocessed a dataset of 10K credit applications and built machine learning models to predict credit default risk, I built an interactive user interface with Streamlit and hosted the web app on Heroku server.

I performed comprehensive EDA to understand important variables, handled missing values, outliers, performed feature engineering, and ensembled machine learning models to predict house prices. My best model had Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 12293.919, ranking **95/15502**, approximately **top 0.6%** in the Kaggle leaderboard.
