## Career Objectives
My name is Chris Tran. I am a **Machine Learning Research Intern** at **Skim AI Technologies**, where I applies latest research in Deep Learning NLP to make machines understand human languages better. Projects I am working on include Sentiment Analysis, Language Generation and Document Summarization. My research interests are in transfer learning, where deep neural networks which were pretained on large corpora to "understand" our langagues can be fine-tuned for different tasks on much smaller datasets to receive near state-of-the-art results.

I am pursuing a master's degree in Business Analytics at the **University of Rochester**, where I receive solid training in Statistics, Machine Learning and Programming. I am proficient in Python and R programming languages, data retrieval and processing with SQL, and data visualization with Tableau, Matplotlib and Seaborn. I am interested in working with large datasets, including cleaning, connecting and mining data. I have completed several Data Science projects and Kaggle competitions, where I built, tuned and ensembled machine learning models such as Regresisons (Ridge, Lasso), Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost and LightGBM. More details about these projects can be found below:

When not working on my projects or studying, I like to read blogs in AI and Machine Learning. I am learning so much from amazing people in the AI community, where knowledge is shared to challenge the boundary of computer intelligence. I also like to read research papers and write codes to reproduce research findings. In my free time, I write blogs and tutorials to discuss topics in Data Science, Machine Learning and NLP. My blog posts can be found below:

## Hobbies
### Photography
I still vividly remember summer nights in my childhood in Vietnam, when a closed friend of mine and I lied in the rooftop of my house looking up to the starry sky. We talked about our dreams, about the vastness of the misterious universe and tried to listen to the sound of the planets moving. The milkyway became a part of my childhood memories. When I grew up, I bought my first DSLR camera to take clear photos of the night sky. Being under billions of bright stars in a quiet night, I feel calm and I hear my inner voice.

I also made short films about cities I visited to retain beautiful memories I had about the culture and people I met on the way.

### Long Distance Running
I started running long distance in 2016. Since then I have completed several half and full-marathons. My most favorite book is ***What I Talk About When I Talks about Running*** by **Haruki Murakami**. His book brought me to running, and through running, I can see so much of me in his book. Running trains me to be quieter and understand myself more clearly.

> “For me, running is both exercise and a metaphor. Running day after day, piling up the races, bit by bit I raise the bar, and by clearing each level I elevate myself. At least that’s why I’ve put in the effort day after day: to raise my own level. I’m no great runner, by any means. I’m at an ordinary – or perhaps more like mediocre – level. But that’s not the point. The point is whether or not I improved over yesterday. In long-distance running the only opponent you have to beat is yourself, the way you used to be.”

> "But really as I run, I don’t think much of anything worth mentioning. I just run. I run in a void. Or maybe I should put it the other way: I run in order to acquire a void."

> "As I run I tell myself to think of a river. And clouds. But essentially I'm not thinking of a thing. All I do is keep on running in my own cozy, homemade void, my own nostalgic silence. And this is a pretty wonderful thing. No matter what anybody else says."
