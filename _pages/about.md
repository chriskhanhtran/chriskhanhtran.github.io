I am pursing a Master's degree in Business Analytics, Data Science at Simon Business School, University of Rochester. I am looking for a job opportunity where I will join a team to utilize advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to build models capable of leveraging all data that business generates and develop solutions that help deliver significant value to the organization.

I have solid quantitative background built from advanced statistics courses and proficiency in statistical programming tools such as Python, R, data retrieval and processing with SQL, and data visualization with Tableau, Matplotlib and Seaborn. I am interested in working with large data sets, including cleaning, connecting, mining data, and developing and optimizing models using machine learning algorithms such as Regressions, Random Forest, SVM and Clustering. I am deepening my knowledge in advanced Data Science topics including Deep Learning, Big Data and NLP.

Besides Data Science, I have a great passion for photography and videography. I also love swimming and running, and have run several half- and full-marathons. These hobbies help me be mindful to see meaning in each small little thing in my life and feel happier everyday.

Core Skills:
• Data Analytics: Data Extraction, Data Cleaning, Data Integration, Exploratory Data Analysis
• Tools: Python, R, SQL, Tableau
• Machine Learning: Regression (Linear/Non-linear, Logistic), Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM and Clustering
