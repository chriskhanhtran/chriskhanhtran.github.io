## Career Objectives
My name is Chris Tran. I am a **Machine Learning Research Intern** at **Skim AI Technologies**, where I applies latest research in Deep Learning NLP to make machines understand human languages better. Projects I am working on include Sentiment Analysis, Language Generation and Document Summarization. My research interests are in transfer learning, where deep neural networks which were pretrained on large corpora to "understand" our languagues can be fine-tuned for different tasks on much smaller datasets to receive near state-of-the-art results.

I am pursuing a master's degree in Business Analytics at the **University of Rochester**, where I receive solid training in Statistics, Machine Learning and Programming. I am proficient in Python and R programming languages, data retrieval and processing with SQL, data visualization with Tableau, Matplotlib and Seaborn. I am interested in working with large datasets, including cleaning, connecting and mining data. I have completed several Data Science projects and Kaggle competitions, where I built, tuned and ensembled machine learning models including Regresisons (Ridge, Lasso), Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost and LightGBM. More details about these projects can be found below:

When not working on my projects or studying, I like to read AI and Machine Learning blogs. I am learning so much from the AI community, where knowledge is shared to challenge the boundary of computer intelligence. I also like to read research papers and write codes to reproduce research findings. In my free time, I write tutorials and blogs to discuss topics in Data Science, Machine Learning and NLP.

## Hobbies
### Photography
I still vividly remember summer nights during my childhood in Vietnam. My close friend and I lay on my house's rooftop looking up to the starry night sky. We talked about our dreams, about the vastness of the misterious universe and tried to listen to the sound of planets moving. The Milky Way has become a part of my childhood memories since then. Growing up, I bought my first DSLR camera to capture clear pictures of the night sky. Being under billions of bright stars in a quiet night, I feel calm and I can hear my inner voice.

I also made short films about cities I visited to keep beautiful memories of cultures and people I met on the way.

### Long Distance Running
I started running long distance in 2016. Since then I have completed several half and full-marathons. Running pushes me to the limits of my physiscal and mental strengths and beyond. My most favorite book is ***What I Talk About When I Talk About Running*** by **Haruki Murakami**. His book brought me to running, and through running, I can see so much of me in his books.

> "As I run I tell myself to think of a river. And clouds. But essentially I'm not thinking of a thing. All I do is keep on running in my own cozy, homemade void, my own nostalgic silence. And this is a pretty wonderful thing. No matter what anybody else says."
