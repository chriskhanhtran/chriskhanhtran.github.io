My most frequently-used tools to complete Machine Learning projects.

## 1. Setup Virtual Machines
- [Google Cloud setup and tutorial](https://github.com/cs231n/gcloud/) (cs231n): A comprehensive tutorial to set up a GCP machine for the course [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) by Stanford 
- [Server setup](https://course.fast.ai/start_gcp.html) (fast.ai): Tutorials to set up virtual machines on Google Cloud, Azure, AWS.. for fast.ai courses.
- [Remote SSH with Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2019/07/25/remote-ssh): A tutorial to connect to VM on VSCode with Remote SSH. It helps working on VM easy and smooth, like working locally.

## 2. Setup Work Spaces
- [Byobu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-byobu-for-terminal-management-on-ubuntu-16-04) for Terminal Management: Byobu allows us to open multiple windows and run multiple commands within a single terminal connection. It becomes very helpful when we train a big neural network. I usually create a window for each of `htop` (for CPUs), `nvidia-smi` (for GPUs), `jupyter lab` and `tensorboard` to monitor my training process.
- [Managing Anaconda environments](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html): Everything we need to know to manage our conda virtual environments.
- [Setting up a Data Science environment using WSL and Jupyter](https://towardsdatascience.com/setting-up-a-data-science-environment-using-windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl-c4b390803dd): This includes guides to set up Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), install Anaconda and Jupyter on Ubuntu.
- [Oh-my-zsh and agnoster theme](https://blog.joaograssi.com/windows-subsystem-for-linux-with-oh-my-zsh-conemu/): Set up a beautiful and functional theme for your terminal.

- [A comprehensive YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9lo_UxSkWA) to set up development environment for machine learning by Abhishek Thakur.
- [Ipykernel](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html#kernels-for-different-environments): Create kernels for different environments so we can switch environments within Jupyter Lab/Notebook.
